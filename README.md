# Deep Learning Approaches for Detecting Credit Card Fraud

## 1. Introduction 
This project aims to better detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using deep learning techniques. Credit card fraud is a serious problem for financial institutions and consumers, causing significant financial losses and compromising security.

## 2. Dataset
1. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oF1OB3Fgd-9MVarUTB4sJYMg1alPZWpt?usp=drive_link
2. Open this link and go back to the folder.
3. OCHuman Folder should be added to the shortcut in google drive.
4. This will allow us to link between Dataset and Google Colab.

## 3. Why this Dataset? 
The dataset used in this study contains credit card transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders in two days. It has a total of 284,807 transactions, with 492 transactions being fraud and the rest non-fraud.

## 5. Results
This section comprehensively discusses the results of the models in terms of how they performed. Before balancing the dataset using SMOTE, ANN performs well on the data as it achieves an accuracy score of  99.8%. This implies that ANN has achieved good performance in detecting fraudulent credit card transactions
